- ASTCheck can always do more sanity checks.
    * Constructor name collisions.
    * SubstFun and FvFun validity.
    * More?

- Lemma names are too long!
    * Maybe something like [subst_intro_...] would be better.
    * Maybe they should not be so dependent on function and predicate names?

- Need (or should have) the following combinations of lemmas:
    * {open, close, subst} x
    * {`in`, `notin`} x
    * {conclusion has open/close/subst, premise has open/close/subst},
      a.k.a., {normal, inv}

- Missing lemmas or ones that need to be moved (probably an incomplete list):
    * subst_degree_inv
    * subst_fresh_same (inv version, too? should be in the Fv file?)
    * subst_fresh (inv version, too? should be in the Fv file?)
    * subst_lc (should be in the Lc file?)
